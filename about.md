Hi! I'm a novel writer based in Waimate, a small town in New Zealand. I write all sorts of genres, but I prefer thriller/supernatural. I actually tend to genre splice and have a heap of trouble selecting a genre for most of my stories. I write both young adult and adult fiction.

I love all things magical and mysterious, from the Loch Ness Monster to fairies. If something goes bump in the night, I'm compelled to find out what that something is, and probably write about it.

Always love to hear from people. Feel free to join my newsletter for the occasional free story, competition, cute photos of my dogs, news, etc!
