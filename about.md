Hi! I'm a novel writer based in Oamaru, a quirky small town in New Zealand. I like to write all sorts of genres, but I prefer thriller/supernatural. I write both young adult and adult fiction.

I love all things magical and mysterious, from the Loch Ness Monster to fairies. If something goes bump in the night, I'm compelled to find out what that something is, and probably write about it.
