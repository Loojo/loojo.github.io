New release.

Following your heart can be deadly. Ignoring it can be even worse.

Orphaned at a young age after a harrowing voyage to New Zealand, English native Laura has suffered more than most. Shown mercy by a clan of formidable Maori tribesmen, she is raised as one of their own.

Years later, English settler James Mason, visits their village and is besotted with Laura. Their relationship blossoms swiftly and it isnâ€™t long before Laura falls pregnant.

Shortly after giving birth to their daughter, Lily, Laura is caught in the middle of a violent clash between two warring cultures, and is gravely wounded and abducted from the village.

Assumed dead by all but James, he vows to find her, while taking up the challenging task of raising his daughter alone in the unforgiving land that is nineteenth century New Zealand.
