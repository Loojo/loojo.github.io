Hi all :) 

I'm working on a new series called Tea Break Books. These are shorter stories that might range from 10 thousand to 40 thousand words. 
I'm a bit of a believer that the story should dictate the word count, not the supposed template for novels.
Since this first one has quite a lot to do with a cat, I've decided to give the profits from it to a local charity from my small town of Waiamte that helps stray cats.

Hope you're all safe and well. Take care!
