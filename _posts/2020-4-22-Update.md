Hi all! Been awhile since I've updated this, sorry! Been quite busy with the little ones. What strange times we are going through at the moment. Hope everybody is keeping safe and managing to read lots! I've got a few of my books for free on Amazon at the moment.
I have a new release coming out in a couple days that I worked on with my mum! It was orginally a dream she had. I wrote it but a lot of it was her story.

I also have a novel I'm writing at the moment called Beneath the Fairy Thorn I hope to get finished soon(ish). Take care :)
