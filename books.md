Being a teenager is hard. It's harder when your parents are wanted criminals; even if they are known as the Robin Hood Vigilantes.

When her parents decide to pull off one last job things don't go as planned, and Milly's mom is left in a coma.
Milly's dad finds a small town near her mom's hospice, seemingly cut off from the outside world. Sure, the residents eat the same boring food every day, and the town is void of any color, but at least nobody there knows about the Robin Hood Vigilantes.

Pear Tree Ville seems a little strange at first, but it isn't long before it turns downright dangerous. Something lurks beneath the surface of Pear Tree Ville, and it's anything but friendly.
